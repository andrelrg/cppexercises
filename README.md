# cppexercises
A couple of exercises in Cpp to train some basic concepts


## Compilation
Just use gcc compiler, this program is compatible with Windows, linux and MacOS.<br>
`g++ main.cpp menu.cpp bigo.cpp essentials.cpp bigofunctions.cpp`

## What will you see?
A menu that `will` contain couple of options to find code examples of some programming problems, you can easily navigate through the menu using w a s d buttons.

### Big O
The first section of this study project is some explatation and some examples of all the types of algorithms complexyties.<br>
If you want to see the examples go to the `bigofunctions.cpp` file, and you will see all the functions.<br>
Executing the program you have a small explanation of each one of them.
